- Add closure-01 support to compiler
- Extract runtime into a header file. This needs to be done anyway and will simplify the generated code, as well as allow C code to be edited in a C file instead of as an embedded string.
- TBD: Can there be a lambda reference that is not a closure or a direct call?
