- interesting (but probably not a big deal):
 (begin (let ((x #f)) (set! x (+ 2 (* 3 4))) (display x)))
 after desugar:
 ((lambda (x) (set! x (+ 2 (* 3 4)))) #f)

 was the begin optimized away?

- Examine each compiler phase, is it good enough?
- Find a cboyer test file we can use
- Destructure cheney on mta runtime, and create code generation for it
- Remove desugaring - let, begin, etc. In a real compiler the macro system would deal with them. This might be harder than it sounds, equivalent let and begin/set forms seemed to generate vastly different code - let was much more compact.
- Just a thought: if this ever became self-hosting, could distribute compiled C files
